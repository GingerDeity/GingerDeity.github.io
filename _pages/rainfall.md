# Description
The original vision for this game came from a game jam that only lasted 90 minutes. There were no win-or-lose conditions, all you could do was click raindrops that would fall in front of a city backdrop with the song "Beneath the Mask" by Shoji Meguro playing in the background. When considering what projects I thought would best show my personality and interests in this portfolio, this was the first that came to mind.

It reminded me of the simple joy of poking at raindrops on the car windows during road trips, which then had me reminiscing about the knick-knacks I would collect on my childhood bedroom windowsill. When looking at the original game, I decided to add items you could get by trading raindrops, as well as a grid inventory system. This game is meant to replicate that very personal experience, so all the items you can collect are things I either had or wanted to have on my windowsill when I was younger. I've attached a video of gameplay below:

What I'm most proud of in this game is the atmosphere, as the sound design and art (all of which were synthesized and drawn by me) all coalesce together into one scene beautifully. It almost feels like it's not your eyes that are gazing out the window, but your past self's eyes. This is a game that you can play for a few moments on your computer, go back to work, and the atmosphere will be right there waiting for you. One thing I believe games can do is to create safe spaces for their users, and I think this game accomplished that brilliantly.

# Development
Development went on far longer than initially expected, as all I planned to do when redesigning the original idea was have the user collect raindrops. There were no plans for items or an inventory, just you and the rain. Once I designed the final background as shown, I knew I had to go the extra mile.

To stay true to the personal goals of this game, I elected to base all the items on things I would've actually owned, and ended up drawing 26 different items.
