# Pain's Walls
This is less of a 'painting' and more of a pencil drawing, where the only paint present is in the eyes. For those unfamiliar, this is a portrait of Hugh Laurie's character Dr. House from the show House M.D. This was a show I became intimately fond of, and his character was someone I found myself loving. Dr. House is one of the most inhuman and human characters I've ever met, endlessly logical yet with emotional motives, embracing pain while always running from it, he is a paradox. I fell in love with the show's portrayal of pain and how characters dealt with it, and so I made this as a sort of 'love letter' once I finished watching all nine seasons. The lines represent his callous logic, and the smudges around them symbolize his logic's hypocrisy and damaging nature to all observers.

# Where She Left
Inspired by the beaches of my hometown of Norfolk, Virginia, this piece is meant to show the beauty and abstraction of the ocean world. It's entirely monochromatic, and you can see faint outlines of seagulls flying in the distance. This is meant to show how that horizon appeared to my more youthful eyes, it shows the line that doesn't end in the most fun colors, fit for any child to play in. Looking at it, you may be able to remember the frying sands, sunscreen, and days out with your family and friends, collecting shells and crabs for hours.

# His Garden
Upon my first viewing of the Studio Ghibli film Howl's Moving Castle, what stuck with me most (aside from the truly masterful soundtrack) was the art of the landscapes. Beautifully colored with gouache paint, there were blue skies, pretty flowers, and clouds that towered over you. This was my attempt to replicate that style slightly, derived from the secret garden that Howl shows to Sophie in the movie. It's a world that doesn't belong to you, but can be experienced by you. It's a place where you meet your one love.
