# Planet's Hope
This piece was originally written by me in high school, and is still to this day one of my absolute favorites that I've done. The piece follows a simple of pattern of C, B, A, G, C, D, F, E, but the form of each new section changes. For me, this song symbolizes hope, repetition, cycles, endurance, light, and the human will to bring about the good in this world.

# Craters in the Dirt
This song is just a simple shift from G minor to A minor and back to G minor, but the notes and simplicity of the piece give it great emotional depth. In this song, there is sadness from heartbreak. It shows the shift from depression to anger to acceptance. The grief in this song doesn't even have to relate to a break-up, rather it's meant to embody the feeling of loss, wherever that may come from.

# Great Fairy Fountain, My Rendition
This song is the only one here that is not an original composition by me, rather it's my rendition of the Great Fairy Fountain by Koji Kondo. It starts with the original song, then shifts into a more complicated chord with octaves. This is one of my favorite songs of all time, so to be able to share my version of it is an immense honor!
