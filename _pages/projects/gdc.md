# Sound Design Meeting
This is from a meeting I hosted where I taught the audience of the Game Development Club at Virginia Tech the basics of sound design. We added sound to an originally silent Zelda animation by user Txikimorin on the r/zelda subreddit. This was the example final product I made before the meeting, using free sound libraries and Wavacity.

# Promotional Materials
These are promotional flyers I made for the Game Development Club at Virginia Tech, inspired by early Atari and Commodore 64 commercials and a general 70s aesthetic. One was made for a school event called GobblerFest, and the other was for our Spring Game Jam of 2025. I'm impressed by how well they came out, considering I've never done any graphic design before!
