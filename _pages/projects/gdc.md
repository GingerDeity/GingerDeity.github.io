My time in the game development club was one of the absolute highlights of my time at Virginia Tech. I had been going since my first semester, but had the opportunity to serve as an officer by Fall '24! I was their secretary until I graduated, the only position that had no true description. The treasurer managed finances, the president led, the vice president assisted the president, and the secretary did... what? I got to pioneer the position, and was responsible for overseeing contracts that led to new meeting venues, guest speakers with decades of experience, and the rest of the work below!

# Character Design Meeting
This was the very first meeting I ever did for the club, focused entirely on character design. My goal for this meeting, and all future meetings, was two-fold: to have the meetings be *interactive classes*, and to focus on areas *outside of programming*. We had a ~95% programming audience, and I wanted to start showing our listeners the world of game-dev outside of that. To start, I had to teach myself character design! Below is the slideshow I created for the class!

# Sound Design Meeting
This is from the next meeting I hosted, where me and my friend Serena taught the basics of sound design! We took an originally silent Zelda animation by user Txikimorin on the r/zelda subreddit, showed the class how to use Wavacity, and gave them a zip file containing sound effects, the template video, and more! This was the example final product I made before the meeting, using free sound libraries and Wavacity.

Below are the slideshows I made for this meeting, one detailing the basics of sound design (which I also had to teach myself), and the next being the help slideshow for Wavacity.

If you'd like to try and do this class yourself, feel free to download the template sounds and video!

# Promotional Materials
These are promotional flyers I made for the Game Development Club at Virginia Tech, inspired by early Atari and Commodore 64 commercials and a general 70s aesthetic. One was made for a school event called GobblerFest, and the other was for our Spring Game Jam of 2025. I'm impressed by how well they came out, considering I've never done any graphic design before!

# Indie Game Showcase
These are the brochure and stickers I created for the Indie Game Showcase our club managed, with both made in a graphic design program called *Canva*. I'm especially proud of the compact nature of the brochure, and the simple but effective sticker design! I definitely consider these to be evolutions from my previous flyers, which were done in PowerPoint.
