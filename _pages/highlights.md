# Art
- ## Pain's Walls
    This is less of a 'painting' and more of a pencil drawing, where the only paint present is in the eyes. For those unfamiliar, this is a portrait of Hugh Laurie's character Dr. House from the show House M.D. This was a show I became intimately fond of, and his character was someone I found myself loving. Dr. House is one of the most inhuman and human characters I've ever met, endlessly logical yet with emotional motives, embracing pain while always running from it, he is a paradox. I fell in love with the show's portrayal of pain and how characters dealt with it, and so I made this as a sort of 'love letter' once I finished watching all nine seasons. The lines represent his callous logic, and the smudges around them symbolize his logic's hypocrisy and damaging nature to all observers.

- ## His Garden
     Upon my first viewing of the Studio Ghibli film Howl's Moving Castle, what stuck with me most (aside from the truly masterful soundtrack) was the art of the landscapes. Beautifully colored with gouache paint, there were blue skies, pretty flowers, and clouds that towered over you. This was my attempt to replicate that style slightly, derived from the secret garden that Howl shows to Sophie in the movie. It's a world that doesn't belong to you, but can be experienced by you. It's a place where you meet your one love.

- ## Where She Left
    Inspired by the beaches of my hometown of Norfolk, Virginia, this piece is meant to show the beauty and abstraction of the ocean world. It's entirely monochromatic, and you can see faint outlines of seagulls flying in the distance. This is meant to show how that horizon appeared to my more youthful eyes, it shows the line that doesn't end in the most fun colors, fit for any child to play in. Looking at it, you may be able to remember the frying sands, sunscreen, and days out with your family and friends, collecting shells and crabs for hours.

# Music
- ## Planet's Hope
    This piece was originally written by me in high school, and is still to this day one of my absolute favorites that I've done. The piece follows a simple of pattern of C, B, A, G, C, D, F, E, but the form of each new section changes. For me, this song symbolizes hope, repetition, cycles, endurance, light, and the human will to bring about the good in this world.

- ## Craters in the Dirt
    This song is just a simple shift from G minor to A minor and back to G minor, but the notes and simplicity of the piece give it great emotional depth. In this song, there is sadness from heartbreak. It shows the shift from depression to anger to acceptance. The grief in this song doesn't even have to relate to a break-up, rather it's meant to embody the feeling of loss, wherever that may come from.

# Miscellaneous
- ## Silk Magnolias
    A poem that was inspired by my (as of 2025) six-year-old sister who I've watched grow up since I was sixteen. There's something very strange about seeing something so fragile that will likely outlive you, about seeing something that doesn't know itself the same way that you do. While I'm no father, I feel like her existence has given me a fraction of a glimpse into what that life would look like. The older I get, the more I envy the way that children see the world, naive yet truly magnificent in its own right. This poem is meant to show that.

- ## Sound Design
    This is from a meeting I hosted where I taught the audience of the Game Development Club at Virginia Tech the basics of sound design. We added sound to an originally silent Zelda animation by user Txikimorin on the r/zelda subreddit. This was the example final product I made before the meeting, using free sound libraries and wavacity.
