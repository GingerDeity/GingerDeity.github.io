# Poem 1
_Why couldn't I be what
you wanted me to be?
Changing myself, like an 
old toy painted over, an
old train given new wheels, a 
puppet who found his new strings

You and your little gestures
and playful manipulations of 
my ere-ticking cuckoo-clock heart
gave me my motions, 
staging for me my emotions

But now with cut silk strings,
can I move without you,
can't I move with you more,
can I move on from you, oh
can't I move on with you?

Lifeless the toyed soul lays as the
impact of that aimless fall
triggers inner strings to tripwires,
transforming finely-tuned turns
of ligaments and nerves into
passionate throws and fits!

Oh, just let me be
your personal little dummy 
for you to hollow his throat 
out with your own script and plays

Pleading, just let me be
your own little automaton
for you to tie my hands into 
whatever time you desire

Crying out, just let me be,
oh just let me be for you!
You played my heartstrings,
and now across the room they
splay and spread, scattered
from the alarmed springs and
ticks of my arrhythmic, stringless,
shattered little heart!

Play with me again! Put me back 
in your cupboard for another rainy day!
Let my painted smile give you pleasure
in ways I can never display for myself!

A web of acoustics now knotted
over every single surface.
You played my heartstrings well,
and now maybe, just maybe,
you can be tangled with me too._
