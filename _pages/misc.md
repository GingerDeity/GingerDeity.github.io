# Heartstrings
This was a poem that was meant to show the pain of loss and the unhealthy obsession that comes with it. In this, the puppet refers to his former lover as his old strings, yearning for that control again. He doesn't care for himself, he doesn't care for his freedom, he only cares for the strings that have hurt him so. What I'm most proud of for this work is the sheer amount of symbolism and different interpretations the reader can have. Was the lover actually in the right for leaving? Was the puppet really the hero? Is there even a lover, or is it just his own self-image he cannot please? It has many different readings, and I'm very pleased with it.

# Silk Magnolias
Another poem, though far less dramatic than the last. This was inspired by my (as of 2025) six-year-old sister who I've watched grow up since I was sixteen. There's something very strange about seeing something so fragile that will likely outlive you, about seeing something that doesn't know itself the same way that you do. While I'm no father, I feel like her existence has given me a fraction of a glimpse into what that life would look like. The older I get, the more I envy the way that children see the world, naive yet truly magnificent in its own right. This poem is meant to show that.

# Sound Design
This is from a meeting I hosted where I taught the audience of the Game Development Club at Virginia Tech the basics of sound design. We added sound to an originally silent Zelda animation by user Txikimorin on the r/zelda subreddit. This was the example final product I made before the meeting, using free sound libraries and wavacity.

# Promotional Flyers
These are promotional flyers I made for the Game Development Club at Virginia Tech, inspired by early Atari and Commodore 64 commercials and a general 70s aesthetics. One was made for a school event called GobblerFest and the other was for our Spring Game Jam of 2025. I'm impressed by how well they came out considering I've never done any graphic design before!
