# Heartstrings
This was a poem that was meant to show the pain of loss and the unhealthy obsession that comes with it. In this, the puppet refers to his former lover as his old strings, yearning for that control again. He doesn't care for himself, he doesn't care for his freedom, he only cares for the strings that have hurt him so. What I'm most proud of for this work is the sheer amount of symbolism and different interpretations the reader can have. Was the lover actually in the right for leaving? Was the puppet really the hero? Is there even a lover, or is it just his own self-image he cannot please? It has many different readings, and I'm very pleased with it.

# Silk Magnolias
Another poem, though far less dramatic than the last. This was inspired by my (as of 2025) six-year-old sister who I've watched grow up since I was sixteen. There's something about seeing something so fragile that will likely outlive you, about seeing something that doesn't know itself the same wya that you do. While I'm no father, I feel like her existence has given me a fraction of a glimpse into what that life would look like. I envy the eyes of a child's, naive yet truly magnificent in its own right. This poem is meant to show that.
