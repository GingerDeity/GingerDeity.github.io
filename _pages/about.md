Hello, as you may have guessed, my name is Atreyu McLewin, and this is my website! I am currently a senior at Virginia Tech majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I am currently in the process of applying for an MFA in Creative Technologies at Virginia Tech and am using this site as my portfolio! My passion is video games, so you'll be seeing many entries that pertain to skills in that industry. You'll find a collection of game works, art, music, and other niches like creative writing and graphic design.

For those who are **reviewing my portfolio and only want to see the most important works, see the "Highlights" Page**, this contains what I believe to be the best entries from all pages. If you're not concerned with speedy evaluations, look around as you please!
