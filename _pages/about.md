## Hello, World!
My name is Atreyu (not affiliated with the *excellent* metalrock band of the same name) and, like all people, I am a **kaleidoscope of vast multitudes**. This website, above all, is meant to be a way to help tell you who I really am! This personal site is divided into two parts, the first being a blog that acts as a weekly progress report on projects and a journal of my general thoughts. The second part is a portfolio filled with completed projects throughout the years. 

I studied Computer Science and Mathematics, and I have a passion for teaching and game design. To me, games are among the greatest forms of storytelling, transforming the audience from spectators to active participants. While my specialty is programming, I hope this website shows that, more than anything, I enjoy all aspects of creation, from art and music to code, and I want to share that journey with you! 

One of my favorite quotes comes from author Howard Thurman, who says:

> *“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”*

For me, creating and sharing is what makes me come alive, and through it I hope to make others come alive. I hope you enjoy the site!

## My Mantra  
***To master discipline over passion, to always strive to be both student and teacher, to take part in life's Neverending Story***

I graduated from college in Spring '25, after which I took a much needed 'half gap-year' to reflect on the last 10 years of burnout. I found myself getting easily locked into cycles of endless grinding away at projects, followed by minimal rest and constant exhaustion. This type of "don't stop" attitude might be good for the occasional project, but for life and a career?... definitely not. 

This is one of the biggest reasons for this website: it's intended as a way to help me learn *discipline over passion*, to remember how to run on fuel, not flames. It's here to show my journey as I continually become both a better *student and teacher* for myself and others. It's here to remind me to always enjoy this *neverending process*, and to encourage sharing that.

## Education & Work Experience
I graduated from Virginia Tech in Spring '25 with a *Bachelor's in Computer Science* and a *Minor in Mathematics*. There, I gave myself plenty of plates to juggle, including...
- Working as an *undergraduate research assistant for nearly 2 years*, exploring and cataloging theoretical benefits of memory deduplication
- Serving as *secretary of the Game Development Club for over a year*, pioneering exclusive contracts that led to a new and improved meeting venue, guest speakers with decades of industry experience, new promotional materials, and two fully-funded game jam events!
- Briefly volunteering part-time *tutoring elementary-school students* about topics such as mathematics and history

To think that's only the work experience I'm mentioning, not the tough-as-railroad-spikes curriculum or personal life conundrums! Still, due to my diligence, support from loved ones, and healthy amounts of luck, I graduated *Magna Cum Laude with a cumulative 3.65 GPA*! I was able to save on finances due to a few scholarships, and having transferred from Tidewater Community College. There, I obtained an *Associate's in General Engineering* with *Summa Cum Laude honors and a 4.0 cumulative GPA*. In the kaleidoscope of my life, it's pretty clear that academics have always been a very significant part!
