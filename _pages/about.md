## Hello, World!
My name is Atreyu (not affiliated with the *excellent* metalrock band of the same name) and, like all people, I am a **kaleidoscope of vast multitudes**. This website/makeshift-blog/portfolio is, above all, meant to be a way to try and tell you who I really am! I hope this will be a platform where I can share my learning journey, both through completed projects in the form of a portfolio and in weekly blog updates on in-progress projects and general thoughts. The following sections will tell you the purpose of this website, future hopes, and my story so far.

## Mission Statement
It may be odd to have a mission statement for what is essentially a personal blog/portfolio, but I find it important as both a way to focus my vision and highlight that for other people. So here it is:  

***To master discipline over passion, to always strive to be both student and teacher, to take part in life's Neverending Story***

I graduated from college in Spring '25, after which I took a much needed 'half gap-year' to reflect and heal from the all-too common academia and college burnout. In general, I tend to be a bit of an 'over-achiever', and can get easily locked in cycles of endless grinding away at projects, only to then have weeks of exhaustion afterwards. This type of attitude might be good for projects and events, but for life and a career?... definitely not. 

This is one of the biggest reasons for this website and blog, it's intended as a way to help me learn the power of *discipline over passion*, to help my train of thoughts remember how to run on fuel, not flames. It's here to show my journey as I continually become both a better *student and teacher* for myself and others. It's here to remind me to always enjoy this *neverending process*.

## The (abridged) story so far...
### Education
I graduated from Virginia Tech in Spring '25 with a *Bachelor's in Computer Science* and a *Minor in Mathematics*. While there, I made sure to give myself plenty of plates to juggle, including...
- Working as an *undergraduate research assistant for nearly 2 years*, exploring and cataloging the theoretical benefits of memory deduplication
- Serving as *secretary of the Game Development Club* from Fall '24 to Spring '25, pioneering exclusive contracts with the school that led to a new and improved meeting venue, guest speakers with decades of industry experience, new promotional materials, and two fully-funded game jam events!
- Briefly volunteering part-time *tutoring elementary-school students* about topics such as mathematics and history

And to think that's only the work experience I'm mentioning, not the tough-as-railroad-spikes curriculum or personal life conundrums! Still, due to my diligence, help from family and friends, and healthy amounts of luck, I graduated *Magna Cum Laude with a cumulative 3.65 GPA*! I was able to save on finances due to a few scholarships, and having transferred from Tidewater Community College. There, I obtained an *Associate's in General Engineering* with *Summa Cum Laude honors and a 4.0 cumulative GPA*! In the kaleidoscope of my life, it's pretty clear that academics have always been a very significant part  

### Languages & Softwares
I'm very grateful to my university for many things, not the least of which being the sheer amount of exposure I had to a wide array of tools and languages...

In my university's classes and research work, I gained proficiency in languages and tools such as
- C
- C++
- Java
- Python
- RISC-V Assembly
- Scheme
- Bash
- VirtualBox
- Ghidra

Meanwhile, my time in the Game Development Club taught me 
- Unity
- Godot
- GameMaker Studio 1 & 2
- Krita
- Audacity
- Blender
- Canva

## The story to come  
I am a kaleidoscope, and depending on how you look through it, you might see a passionate programmer, philosopher, storyteller, calisthenics novice, cinema nerd, musician, writer, or an overall artist.  

My study was computer science, and in that field, my true passion is teaching and game design. For me, games are one of the greatest forms of storytelling, turning the audience from spectators into active participants. For me, game design is the **study of empowerment and fun**, and I strive to make products that excel in both areas! My specialty is programming, but I hope this website shows that, more than anything, I enjoy all aspects of creation. I paint, do character designs, sound design, write music, tell stories, and (best of all) share it with you! 

One of my favorite quotes comes from author and philosopher Howard Thurman, who says, “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” For me, programming, creating, and game design are what make me come alive, and through it I should hope to make others come alive as well. I hope you enjoy!
