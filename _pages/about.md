I'm a senior at Virginia Tech majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics, graduating Spring of 2025! My current job is an undergraduate research assistant, where I research the potential benefits of memory deduplication. I also volunteer part-time teaching Hispanic children abot topics such as Mathematics and History. I'm also an officer at the Game Development Club at Virginia Tech, serving as their Secretary since Fall 2024. I have experience with several programming languages and software, including C, C++, Java, Python, RISC-V Assembly, Godot, GameMaker Studio 1+2, Bash, VirtualBox, Qemu, KSM, and more!

While my major may be computer science, my true passion is in teaching and game design. For me, games are one of the greatest forms of storytelling, capable of turning its audience from spectators into active participants. For me, game design is the study of empowerment and fun, and I strive to make products that excel in both areas! My specialty is programming, but I hope this website shows that, more than anything, I am proficient in many aspects of the medium. I can paint, do character design, sound design, write music, tell stories, and more. I suppose you could actually say my specialty is really communications! My wide range of talents and experience means that, while I may be no expert at any one thing, I can communicate effectively with all sorts of people!

One of my favorite quotes comes from author and philosopher Howard Thurman who says “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” For me, game design and the arts are what make me come alive, and through it I should hope to make others come alive as well. Enjoy the art!
