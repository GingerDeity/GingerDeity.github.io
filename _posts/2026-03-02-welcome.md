Welcome to the very first of my blog posts!

<!--more-->

Man, there's so much I could talk about, so much I want to talk about, but I guess I should start with the basics, like:

## Why did I make this site?
Above all, I just really wanted my own way to help tell people who I really am! I wanted to show what I've already accomplished, what I'm currently doing, and what I plan on in the future. Hence, I divided the site into two main parts, the first being this very blog, and the second part being a [compilation of projects](https://gingerdeity.github.io/projects/).

The other reason for making this site? I really wanted a way to incentivize my continued learning! This blog, while personal and will share many personal thoughts and feelings, will also act as a weekly progress report on projects. I'm someone very new to this career space, and I want employers and coworkers to look at this and in one glance realize 'oh, this is someone who is disciplined and always learning!'

That's yet another huge motivation for me, this is intended as a way to help me learn *discipline over passion*, to remember how to run on fuel, not flames. It's here to show my journey as I continually become both a better *student and teacher* for myself and others. It's here to remind me to always enjoy this *neverending process*, and to encourage sharing that.

## What should you expect?
If you happened to click on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atreyu-mclewin-a48b5528a/) (thank you if you did!), hopefully you'll have noticed the banner:

**Programmer by Trade**  
My specialty and main interest is programming. You'll see a lot of posts and projects that either are programming-oriented or, at the very least, programming-adjacent. Expect many projects or progress reports revolving around languages like Python, C++, JS, etc!

**Designer by Mindset**  
Even though programming is my career, don't be surprised to see posts or thoughts that have more to do with design and the design process! My parents were theatre, art, and philosophy majors, and a good portion of that definitely transferred into me (love you mom and dad :D). 

**Game Developer at Heart**  
Games have been a huge part of my life ever since I was a child. I find the form of storytelling in games to be the most incredibly fascinating form of storytelling so far. In nearly all other avenues of storytelling, the audience is rarely anything more than passive spectators. But in games? You become the active participant. Games like *Ocarina of Time* didn't just tell or show me heroics, it allowed me to *practice* heroics, games like *Star Wars Battlefront II* let me practice strategy, *Portal 2* got me interested in science, the list goes on.

I am a programmer by trade, with a designer mindset, who loves making and playing games. Expect a lot of projects and posts about that.

## What's next?
There are *several* projects I could go back and touch up, but right now, here's the current plan:
- Start learning JS and HTML
- Continue development of Frog Runner

I have very little experience with JS, and I just love how far the Frog Runner prototype has come so far! My brother just recently finished the character concept pieces, so we'll hopefully be adding in 3D models of those drawings soon enough. 

## Final Thoughts
I'm really excited to finally have a place where I'm confident to show off my projects, and a place that'll motivate me to keep learning this profession! I can't wait to share more with you all. That's all for now folks, until next time!
